## Introduction

Hey! My name is Mia and I'm a 15 year old sophomore. My favorite books are a trilogy called The Summer I turned pretty by Jenny Han, and my favorite movies are 10 things I hate about you and 27 dresses. If you couldn't tell, I just really like rom-coms! A new skill that I recently learned is how to play tennis. Not too recent but I started playing this year and will be playing on the Chatsworth team too. Some fun facts about me are I have two brothers, I'm bilingual, and I LOVE minions! My goals for this school year are to get all A’s and pass all my AP classes. One of my favorite travel experiences was going to France last year. I mostly just ate A LOT. And my favorite food is a custom bowl from Cava.

In this class I just hope I can learn more on coding and maybe relearn some of the stuff from last year because I forgot some. I also hope I can achieve a 3 or higher on the AP test. The most recent tech project I have worked on was the app I made for the AP exam. Me and my partner made an app that loads dc characters and writes their name, eye color, first appearance, etc. 

As mentioned before, I play tennis here at Chatsworth and I'm still learning a lot of skills and techniques. Some more creative activities that I do are sew, do nails, and do people's makeup and hair. To be honest, I didn’t really do any volunteer work or community service over the summer since I was busy with traveling and my nose surgery. I also didn’t take part in any family traditions because they’re mostly during the holidays. My favorite summer memory with my friends was probably just hanging out with them because it's always fun! A big part of what influenced what I wanted to be when I grew up was my brother. He’s currently studying to be a dentist and just seeing how hard he works made me want to follow in his footsteps and also become a dentist in the future hopefully! Bye!
